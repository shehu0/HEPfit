SusyFit - a Fitting Tool for the Standard Model and Beyond
===================================================================

version 0.1
-----------

SusyFit is a flexible tool which, given the Standard Model or any extension,
allows to:

  - fit the model parameters to a given set of experimental observables
  - obtain fit results for observables
  - obtain predictions for observables

SusyFit can be used:

  - as an executable in Monte Carlo mode, to perform a Bayesian Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo analysis of the given model
  - as an executable in single event mode, to obtain predictions of observables
    for a given point in the parameter space of the model
  - in library mode, to obtain predictions of observables for a given point
    in the parameter space of the model, allowing our computational tool to
    be used in any statistical framework

The Monte Carlo mode is based on the BAT (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit) library.
